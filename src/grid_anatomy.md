* Grid track—A grid track is the space between two adjacent grid lines. A grid has horizontal tracks (rows) and vertical tracks (columns).
* Grid cell—A single space on the grid, where a horizontal grid track and a vertical grid track overlap.
* Grid area—A rectangular area on the grid made up by one or more grid cells. The area is between two vertical grid lines and two horizontal grid lines.
